        <h2>Learning and Growing in Web Development</h2>
        <p>My web development journey began with the basics—learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I dove deeper into frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. Along the way, I’ve built a variety of projects, from simple landing pages to dynamic, data-driven websites. Each project has taught me new skills and given me a greater appreciation for how the web works.</p>

        <p>The most exciting part of web development is the constant evolution of tools and techniques. As I continue to explore backend technologies, APIs, and frameworks like Node.js and Express, I realize just how much potential the web has to offer. I can’t wait to continue creating innovative web applications and contributing to the open-source community!</p>
