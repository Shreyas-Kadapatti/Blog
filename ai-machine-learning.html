        <h2>My Journey into AI and ML</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have always fascinated me. My interest started with basic algorithms and evolved as I learned more about neural networks, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Working on projects involving data analysis, predictive models, and AI-based applications has been an eye-opening experience. I’ve had the chance to experiment with popular libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, and I’m excited to continue building in this space!</p>

        <p>One of the most exciting aspects of AI and ML is their potential to impact almost every sector—healthcare, education, entertainment, and even environmental sustainability. I’m constantly learning new techniques, and I’m eager to apply them to real-world challenges to create intelligent systems that can make a difference.</p>
